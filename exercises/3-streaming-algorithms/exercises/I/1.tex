We can use the same line of reasoning as that is used for \textbf{Theorem~8.1} in the Course Notes on Streaming Algorithms.

Suppose a deterministic streaming algorithm \textsc{Alg} for \textsc{Element Uniqueness} uses at most $s$ bits of storage.
Then \textsc{Alg} can only be in $2^s$ different states at any point in time.
In particular, \textsc{Alg} can only be in $2^s$ different states after processing the first $m - 1$ tokens in the stream.

On the other hand, the number of different frequency vectors $F[1, \ldots, n]$ that can be generated by a stream of $m - 1$ tokens from $\left[n\right]$ is:

\[
	{n + m - 1 - 1 \choose n - 1} \geq \left(\frac{n + m - 2}{m - 1}\right)^{m - 1} = 2^{(m - 1\log\left(\frac{2\left(n+m - 2\right)}{m}\right))}
\]

Hence, when $s < m - 1\log\left(\frac{2\left(n + m - 2\right)}{m}\right)$ there must be two sequences $\sigma_1 = <a_1, \ldots, a_{m - 1}>$ and $\sigma'_1 = <a'_1, \ldots, a'_{m - 1}>$ with the following property:
$\sigma_1$ and $\sigma'_1$ define different frequency vectors but \textsc{Alg} is in exactly the same state after processing $\sigma_1$ as it would be after processing $\sigma'_1$.

Consider a $j_1 \in [n]$.
Let $\sigma_1$ consist entirely out of unique elements, not containing $j_1$.
Let $\sigma_1'$ consist entirely out of unique elements, containing $j_1$.
Now let $\sigma_2 = <j_1>$ be a stream with one element, $j_1$.
Clearly, all items in $\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2$ are distinct, while item $j_1$ occurs in $\sigma_1' \circ \sigma_2$ twice.

Since \textsc{Alg} is deterministic and the state of \textsc{Alg} after processing $\sigma_1$ is the same as it would be after processing $\sigma'_1$, we can conclude that \textsc{Alg} will report the same answer for the stream $\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2$ as it would for $\sigma'_1 \circ \sigma_2$.
However, this is incorrect, since $\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2$ satisfies \textsc{Element Uniqueness}, but $\sigma'_1 \circ \sigma_2$ does not.
Hence, any deterministic streaming algorithm that solves \textsc{Element Uniqueness} exactly must use at least $\Theta\left(m \log\left(\frac{2n}{m}\right)\right)$.

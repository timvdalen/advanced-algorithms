The proof assumes that $F_\sigma\[j\] \geq 0$ for all $j$.
In the general turnstile model, this assumptions is not valid, as the frequency of an item can become negative.

It uses this assumption to say that:

\begin{quote}
	Hence, $X_s \geq 0$ for any $s$, which implies that  $F_\sigma\[j\] \leq \~F_\sigma\[j\]$.
\end{quote}

This is no longer valid because $X_s$ can become negative.

Furthermore, we can only use the Markov's Inequality if our random variable can only be positive, so we can not use it to bound the probability.

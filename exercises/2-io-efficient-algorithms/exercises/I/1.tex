\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item
There are $m$ collumns to traverse. While processing each collumn $M/B$ blocks can remain in main memory, that is all but one of the blocks in one collumn. Meaning that per collumn there is only one I/O required in addition to the number of blocks in which the matrix is stored $n/B$. Therefor we would need $O(n/B + m) = O(n/B + \sqrt(n))$ I/O's if we use Most-Recently-Used as our replacement policy. This works because the block that was most recently-used will be needed again at the latest time of all the blocks in memory at any time.

	\item
After $M/B$ blocks have been put into main memory there will be the need to read $m - M/B$ other blocks before any of the first blocks are required. This clarifies that we could keep $M/B-1$ common blocks loaded for each $m/B$ rows but this would lead to an insignificant improvement. We would need $\Omega(m * (m - \frac{M/B-1}{m/B}))$ I/O's.

Since $m > 2M/B$, we can derive that $\frac{M/B-1}{m/B} = \frac{M}{m} - B < \frac{M}{2M/B} - B = \frac{M * B}{2M} - B = \frac{M-1}{2M} * B < \frac{1}{2}*B$ which is a constant factor.

We can conclude that any replacement policy will perform $\Omega(m * m) = \Omega(n)$ I/O's

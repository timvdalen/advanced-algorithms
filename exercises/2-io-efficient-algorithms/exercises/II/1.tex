We will compare the I/O performance of optimal caching and LRU on a machine with memory $M$ to the I/O performance of optimal caching on a machine with memory $M' = M/2$.

We define \textsc{Alg\_Min} to be the the algorithm running with an optimal caching strategy.
We define \textsc{Alg\_Lru} to be the the algorithm running with LRU.

We know that running \textsc{Alg\_Min} on the machine with memory $M$ takes $cn\sqrt{n}/(MB)$ I/O's.
Running \textsc{Alg\_Min} on the machine with memory $M'$ will double the amount of I/O's, to $2cn\sqrt{n}/(MB)$.
Running \textsc{Alg\_Lru} on the with memory $M$ takes $c'n\sqrt{n}/(MB)$.

The LRU replacement policy evicts the memory block that was used the longest ago by the algorithm.

\end{figure}

Consider the timeline in Figure~\ref{fig:ii:1:timeline}.
The total run of the algorithm is divided up into periods of time $T_i$, each having $M/B$ block reads, except for the first one, which can have less.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \# of I/O's of \textsc{Alg\_Min} during $T_0$ = \# of I/O's of \textsc{Alg\_Lru} during $T_0$, since everything needs to be read into memory
	\item Consider $T_i$ for $i > 0$.\\
		\textbf{Claim} \textsc{Alg\_Min} does $\geq \frac{M}{B} - \frac{M'}{B} + 1$ I/O's.\\
		\[
			\frac{\textsc{Alg\_Lru} \textnormal{ during } T_i}{\textsc{Alg\_Min} \textnormal{ during } T_i} \leq \frac{M/B}{\frac{M}{B} - \frac{M'}{B} + 1} = \frac{M}{M-M'+B}
		\]
		\textbf{Define} b = block that is used just before $T_i$ starts\\
		\textbf{Proof}
			\begin{description}
				\item[Case 1] $b$ is evicted by LRU during $T_i$.
					At the start of $T_i$, MIN can only load $M'/B$ in internal memory, it needs $\frac{M}{B} - (\frac{M'}{B} - 1)$
				\item[Case 2] Some $b' \not= b$ is evicted twice by LRU during $T_i$.
					Same argument for $b'$.
				\item[Case 3] No blocks are evicted twice.
					All reads on a different block, so MIN needs $\frac{M}{B} - (\frac{M'}{B} - 1)$.
			\end{description}
\end{itemize}

So we know that:

\begin{align*}
	LRU(ALG, M) &\leq \frac{M}{M-M'+B} MIN(ALG, M')\\
	LRU &\leq 2 MIN
\end{align*}

Thus, we can now say that $\frac{c'}{c} = 2$, or $c' = 2c$.

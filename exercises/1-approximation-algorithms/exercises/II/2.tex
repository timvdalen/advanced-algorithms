\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item In the best case, the same literal shows up in all clauses.
		Thus, we have
		\[
		OPT \geq 1
		\]
		as the lower bound.

		Consider the following CNF with $m$ clauses
		\[
			(x_1 \lor x_2 \lor x_3) \land (x_4 \lor x_5 \lor x_3) \land (x_6 \lor x_7 \lor x_3) \land \ldots \land (x_{2m} \lor x_{2m+1} \lor x_3)
		\]

		Then, the algorithm could pick the $x_1, x_4, x_6, \ldots, x_{2m}$, $m$ literals.
		Note that we have $2m + 1$ variables, so $n = 2m + 1$.
		This is the worst case possible because since no literals can be negated, picking one literal from each clause and setting it to true will always result in true.

		Take $T$ to be the number of literals set to true by the algorithm.
		Then,
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			T & \leq m  \\
				& \leq \frac{n-1}{2}\\
				& \leq \frac{n-1}{2} * LB \\
				& \leq \frac{n-1}{2} * OPT
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}

		So, the given algorithm is a $\frac{n-1}{2}$-approximation.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item Since the large jobs take at least $\epsilon * T$ if we want to know the maximum number of large jobs we need to see howmany jobs of exactly that size could be part of the total time $T$. 
\[ \text{There are at most} \left \lfloor\frac{T}{\epsilon * T} \right \rfloor = \left \lfloor \frac{1}{\epsilon} \right \rfloor \text{large jobs} \] 
If there are $m$ large jobs, these can be distributed $2^m$ ways over two machines.
